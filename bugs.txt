UNREAL BUGS
- no detection for collision for dropped actors
- quest reward UI doesnt show text
- Quest NPC shows quest after completion
- double clicking the quest duplicates the objective information
- jetpack only refills when on screen (Maybe bc it isnt removed??)
- switching MAIN UIs (Quest and inventory) doesnt keep the game paused. 
----Can also open duplicates of UI
----Quest Screen still relies on button to close
